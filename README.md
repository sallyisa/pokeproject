# Pokemon Project

Requires pyspark to run the `pokemon-notebook.ipynb` notebook. Bonus questions are addressed at the bottom of the notebook :)

The output file is in the `pokemon_out_csv/` directory.	

To run the streamlit dashboard locally: 
     
- install streamlit
```>> pip install streamlit```
- run the app
```>> streamlit run pokemon_streamlit_app.py```
